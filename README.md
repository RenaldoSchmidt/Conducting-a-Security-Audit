# SecurityAudit
Part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate was to conduct a security audit on a fictional e-commerce company. A fictional email was received from management at the company including the audits' scope and goals, as well as the assets under management and a risk assessment. I followed this up by doing a controls assessment on the vulnerable assets, then I compared this to a compliance checklist, and finally, I wrote a stakeholders memorandum informing them of the results and my recommendations. 
This section shows my work auditing the fictional company in a PDF file titled "Conducting a Security Audit" which you can click to open on this page (If you scroll down far enough after opening the file you may have to click more pages on the bottom of the file to see the whole file).
