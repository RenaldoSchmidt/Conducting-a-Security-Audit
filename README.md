# SecurityAudit
Part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate was to conduct a security audit on a fictional e-commerce company. A fictional email was received from management at the company including the audits' scope and goals, as well as the assets under management and a risk assessment. I followed this up by doing a controls assessment on the vulnerable assets, then I compared this to a compliance checklist, and finally, I wrote a stakeholders memorandum informing them of the results and my recommendations. This section shows my work auditing the fictional company in a PDF file (you may have to click more pages on the bottom of the file to see the whole file).
