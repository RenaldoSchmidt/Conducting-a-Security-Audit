# SecurityAudit
Part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate was to conduct a security audit on a fictional e-commerce company. A fictional email was received from management at the company including the audits' scope and goals, as well as the assets under management and a risk assessment. This section shows my work auditing the fictional company in a PDF file (you may have to click more pages on the bottom of the file to see the whole file).
